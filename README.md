Simple A/B testing and feature flags for iOS built on top of [Switchboard](https://github.com/KeepSafe/Switchboard).

## What it does

## What it does not do

## Installation

## Example Usage

There is an example app under the `SwitchboardExample` target within the project file that you can run and see the debug user interface. This debug interface comes in handy when you want to test various flows within your app (e.g. enable `featureA` and verify the code does X, then disable `featureA` and verify the code does Y) or you want to put yourself into a given experiment cohort to see what that user experience will look like to others. 

The example might also be helpful in showing you our Switchboard setup recommendations so you can more easily integrate the debug interface into your own app.
